# Work-Day-Scheduler

This [project](./assets/images/Preview.png) is a culmination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I included the use of Moments.js to show the current date & show if the time on the schedule has already passed or not.

The purpose of this project is to allow the user to add items to their work day schedule. Although it is not fully functional yet, ultimately the addition of Local Storage will allow the items added to be saved & rendered within the days schedule for that time frame.
